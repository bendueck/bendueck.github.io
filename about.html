      <h3>About</h3>
      <br>
		<p>This page is supposed 
          to be about me. My name is Ben. I was born in Maryland, USA and briefly lived in Heidelberg, Germany and Alabama, USA. But I grew up in Tsawwassen, British Columbia Canada. I graduated from high school at Richmond Christian School in 2019. Then I studied at Trinity Western University for one year. Then, during the pandemic, I worked as a lifeguard at the City of Delta and camp counsellor at Camp Cascades in Yelm, Washington. I also started producing music using Ableton Live. In 2021, I moved to Edmonton, Alberta and currently am a Business Student at The King's University. I am graduating in May 2024. That's my life! Here is a link to my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bendueck/">LinkedIn</a> and my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ben.dueck.902/">Facebook</a> if you want to know more. Enjoy!
